        <h1>Hello, I am Pierre-Alexandre Mousset - Software Developer</h1>

        <p>
            I am currently a Software Engineer Intern at Artefact where I am working on the deployment of a Machine
            Learning model that measures the impact of TV advertising on sales.
            <br><br>
            This internship is part of curriculum at Northeastern university where I am pursuing my Master in Computer
            Science. In my free time, I am working on a outdoor photo sessions platform that are free to book and allow
            customers to pay only for photos they chose.

        <p> My first programming experience was at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.asia-hr.com/">Asia-HR</a> where
            I designed, developed and deployed a job-search platform. After working on <a target="_blank"
                href="https://www.climatetree.wiki/">ClimateTree</a> with my classmates, I am now helping my <a
                target="_blank" href="http://www.vetements-mousset.fr">parents</a> transition from a brick-and-mortar to
            an online business.
